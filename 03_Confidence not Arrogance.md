When your confidence is at rock bottom, how to build it back up, without it turning into arrogance. Based partly on this [article on Medium](https://medium.com/remote-symfony-team/a-secret-to-success-confidence-without-arrogance-17191d46c50d) plus some additions.  This advice seems pretty consistent and reasonable from many sources.

_“What you think of yourself is much more important than what people think of you.”_
~ *Seneca* 

**Do these things**
1. Be Sincere -- By being sincere I build trust and confidence in others
2. Be approachable -- Remember & use people's names, engage in positive coversations, make eye contact, body language that neither intimidates nor shows disinterest.  Shoulders back, head up, arms open, straight posture, smiling, sensible distance.
3. Surround myself with positive and confident people.  It's really important to be with these kind of people, and limit time with negative people that will put me down to boost their hollow egos, or discourage new ideas.
4. Know my strengths -- My true strengths are where I get my self-worth, and I should recognise them, and enjoy devoting time to them.  Never let anybody idealise me as something else.
5. Know my limitations -- Knowing when I'm out of my depth is acknowledging the chance for improvement.
6. Be humble -- Avoid boasting, act modestly, but don't talk myself down either.
7. Talk less, listen more -- Truly confident people can see through big talkers.
8. Don't be afraid to be wrong -- Being wrong is part of learning and becomming better.
9. Be vulnerable -- Let others in, don't have anything to hide.
10. Be mindful  -- Keeps you grounded, and calm.
11. Be inspiring -- Let others be inspired, but without having to anounce yourself to them.
12. Review and repeat.  -- Check myself to make sure I'm not drifting towards arrogance.

**Traps to avoid**
- Don't over-share on social-media, or even get hooked into public conversations.  It looks insecure, and leaves me feeling anxious.  Too much of this is definately the pathway to arrogance, none at all is quite OK. People that want to know more about me can always ask, or look me up in a multitude of ways.
- Don't over-share in texting conversations about my daily life and adventures.  It's almost as bad as the above.  Not quite, as it only affects the people I'm talking to, but anyway if I overdo this the effect is the same.
- Comparing myself to others.  People always project only their best bits, so I'm guarenteed to feel worse by making silly comparisons.  Especially when I have more diverse interests than anyone else.  Just focus on my own strengths instead.  Eg. beating my own Strava times is really more meaningful than fussing over where I am on any leaderboard.  The same goes for Kaggle competitions, learning goals, mountain biking, ocean swimming, climbing etc.

**Wierd things that seem to work for me**
* **Strava** I've got just 5 followers, they're all friends I know pretty well, and I don't need extra validation from. I'm mainly just trying to beat my own time up and down the Maitai Dam.  This is good for internal confidence to enjoy watching my fitness improve.
* **DuoLingo**  It's addictive, ten times more productive than anything I could do on Facebook or Linkedin, I'm good at languages, I enjoy learning, I like the confidence that comes with conversing with new people in another tongue, and on the app I'm competing with imaginary people who have never heard of me and I'll never know.
* Timing & recording my swims out to the council bouy.  Just let my shoulder recover properly first.
* Shredding the grade 5 downhills with fun people.
