When your confidence is at rock bottom, how to build it back up, without it turning into arrogance. Based partly on this [article on Medium](https://medium.com/remote-symfony-team/a-secret-to-success-confidence-without-arrogance-17191d46c50d) plus some additions.  This advice seems pretty consistent and reasonable from many sources.

_“What you think of yourself is much more important than what people think of you.”_
~ *Seneca* 

This good table [from here](https://www.mindtools.com/selfconf.html)
|Confident Behaviour |Behavior Associated with Low Self-Confidence |
|:----|:----|
|Doing what you believe to be right, even if others mock or criticize you for it | Governing your behavior based on what other people think |
| Being willing to take risks and to go the extra mile to achieve better things| Staying in your comfort zone, fearing failure, and avoiding risk |
| Admitting your mistakes and learning from them| Working hard to cover up mistakes and hoping that you can fix the problem before anyone notices |
| Waiting for others to congratulate you on your accomplishments |Extolling your own virtues as often as possible to as many people as possible |
| Accepting compliments (and criticism) graciously "Thanks, I really worked hard on that prospectus. I'm pleased you recognize my efforts" | Dismissing compliments offhandedly. "Oh, that prospectus was nothing, really. Anyone could have done it." |

Actually, that first column is usually me, even now.  Never let anyone tell me otherwise, or feel bad about it my past efforts!  It's just that 'fearing failure', in the right hand column I've been having trouble with lately.  Just be patient, I've been through a lot, and it's not a competition.

Low self-confidence can be self-destructive, and may manifest itself as negativity. Self-confident people are generally more positive – they value themselves and trust their judgement. But they also acknowledge their failures and mistakes, and learn from them.

#### Do these things
1. Be Sincere -- By being sincere I build trust and confidence in others
2. Be approachable -- Remember & use people's names, engage in positive conversations, make eye contact, body language that neither intimidates nor shows disinterest.  Shoulders back, head up, arms open, straight posture, smiling, sensible distance.
3. Surround myself with positive and confident people.  It's really important to be with these kinds of people. And limit time with negative ones that will put me down to boost their egos, or discourage new ideas.
4. Know my strengths -- My true strengths are where I get my self-worth, and I should recognise them, and enjoy devoting time to them.  Never let anybody idealise me as something else.
5. Know my limitations -- Knowing when I'm out of my depth is acknowledging the chance for improvement.
6. Be humble -- Avoid boasting, act modestly, but don't talk myself down either.
7. Talk less, listen more -- Truly confident people can see through big talkers.
8. Don't be afraid to be wrong -- Being wrong is part of learning and becoming better.
9. Be vulnerable -- Let others in, don't have anything to hide.
10. Be mindful  -- Keeps you grounded, and calm.
11. Be inspiring -- Let others be inspired, but without having to announce yourself to them.
12. Review and repeat.  -- Check myself to make sure I'm not drifting towards arrogance.

#### Another good list for building up confidence, that's much simpler:

1. **Build Confident Habits** --
	To develop and improve your self-esteem, aim to develop good habits – and break bad ones. Regular exercise and a healthy diet, sleep etc. See the [[04_Anxiety Management]] section.  I think for me, really the only one left is to improve my work habits and focus.  I've already learned enough from my other mistakes.

	Working on your [personal branding](https://www.creativeboom.com/tips/being-you-how-to-build-your-personal-brand-and-confidence-according-to-maggie-eyre/) can also help. If you project a positive image of your authentic self, you'll likely start to receive the positive feedback that's so important to your self-confidence.  Just don't overdo this, for me it tends to become an anxious habit of its own.
2. **Set confidence boosting goals** -- 
	- Master OOP & make really good notes
	- First Kaggle bronze medal, or just keep improving
	- Complete a real-world AI project
	- Do a couple of conservation related GIS projects
	- Get more fluent at French, Mandarin and Spanish.  Practice with real people
	- Get really solid at Python development, build up code-snippets & document leanings
	- Learn my way around VSCode more thoroughly
	- Keep up my GitHub contributions, and get comfortable doing it from command line
	- Master the art of staying focused while working on my own
	- Finish getting my GIS portfolio into a presentable state  
		**That's enough for this year!**
3. **Review past achievements** -- "I can do this, and here's the evidence."  Just don't get hung up on how they look to others.  I'm about to enter my third really challenging tech field, hardly anybody does this, just be patient!

#### Traps to avoid
- Don't over-share on social-media, or even get hooked into public conversations.  It looks insecure, and makes me feel anxious.  Too much of this is definitely the pathway to insecurity, none at all is quite OK. People that want to know more about me can always ask, or look me up in a multitude of ways.
- Actually, just  stay away from social media in general.  There are better ways to make friends and contacts.  The  LinkedIn news feed is lethal for anxiety and confidence.
- Don't over-share in texting conversations about my daily life and adventures.  It's almost as bad as the above.  Not quite, as it only affects the people I'm talking to, but anyway if I overdo this the effect is the same.
- Corporate & academic HR departments.  These have never been a very effective way to find employment, and the processes themselves are usually ineffective and humiliating.
- Comparing myself to others.  People always project only their best bits, so I'm guaranteed to feel worse by making silly comparisons.  Especially when I have more diverse interests than anyone else.  Just focus on my own strengths instead.  Eg. beating my own Strava times is really more meaningful than fussing over where I am on any leaderboard.  The same goes for Kaggle competitions, learning goals, mountain biking, ocean swimming, sailing, climbing etc.

#### Wierd things that seem to work for me lately
* **Strava** I'm mainly just trying to beat my own time up and down the Maitai Dam.  This is good for internal confidence to enjoy watching my fitness improve.
* **Duo Lingo**  It's addictive, positive, productive, I enjoy learning, I like the confidence that comes with conversing with new people in another tongue.
* Timing & recording my swims out to the council bouy or around the harbour.  Just let my shoulder recover properly first.
* Shredding downhill trails with Angela or Karyn.
