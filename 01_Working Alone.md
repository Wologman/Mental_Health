It's OK to find this hard.  Everybody does, it's a skill in its own right. It can be mastered, but it will take some effort and focus on good methods.  The reward for achieving this is quite good, I can always find other ways to socialise.  Or apply these same skills in a normal office setting.

### Skill #1: Silencing inner demons and going with the flow
Definately struggling with this one.  The nine elements of flow are: 

1. There are clear goals every step of the way. 
2. There is immediate feedback to one’s actions. 
3. There is a balance between challenges and skills. 
4.  Action and awareness are merged. 
5.  Distractions are excluded from consciousness. 
6.  There is no worry of failure. 
7.   Self-consciousness disappears. 
8.  The sense of time becomes distorted. 
9.  The activity becomes autotelic (having an end or purpose in itself)

I'm strugglig with (3) and (6), (7) I already noted this in [[04_Anxiety Management]] my anxiety notes.  Refer to those and keep working on this.

### Skill #2: The ability to face distractions head on
This I'm still struggling with.  Recognise what the distractions are, and do what ever I can to keep them away.  Especially social media.  Make sure I'm logged out of all of it, and don't go near it during my focussed time.

If tempted to procrastinate, go to XKCD or Duolingo, at least then I'm doing something positive or productive.

### Skill #3: The ability to know when the day is done
This one I can do already, just stop when I'm getting tired enough that I'm slowing down.  Know that I've already given it 100%.  Go enjoy the rest of the day.

Try to be more strict about getting on with the job early, so the anxiety about it doesn't build up.

### Skill #4: The ability to find your natural habitat
We're all different.  Find what works for me.  I seem to do best in co-work spaces.  I like to have a good computer setup, and a business like environment around me.  Draw strength from having others nearby.  

But I could imagine having a nice studio in the garden, that could work too.  I don't seem to do the coffee shop-work thing.  Better just go there for coffee.
