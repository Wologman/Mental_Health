I had a really awful time transitioning to self-employed remote work, it was by far the worst year of my life.  Mostly due to external factors, but working alone without a secure long term project definately compounded things. 

I found myself in an epic battle with anxiety and depression, and flying down to the Christchurch office just to be around my old mates. I took four months off paid work to recover and make sure it never happens again. I'm still going to a therapist once a week, but I'm doing much better now.  

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for new answers.  This was good for my own confidence to remind myself that I've already mastered the topic, there's nothing more to search for.  I just need to focus on patiently improving *the art of work*.

All else being equal I'd rather have an on-site workplace with fun colleagues. But the reward if I can succeed at remote work is huge.  I could smash the disconnect I've long been frustrated with between the right job opportunities and great locations to live.

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, effective remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence rather than arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
