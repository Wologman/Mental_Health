My transition to self-employed remote work was so traumatic I ended up in a 12 month battle with anxiety and depression. There were other factors besides work, but being on my own and without much structured time really didn't help. I'm still going to a therapist, but doing much better now.  

I found it better to write up my own notes like this than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for new answers.  I don't expect them to be particularly relevant to anybody else, except possibly to start a similar journey.  

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, effective remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence rather than arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
