# Mental_Health

I had a really awful time while I was transitioning to self-employed remote work. It was by far the worst year of my life, due mainly to some external factors but working alone compounded everything. I found myself in an epic battle with anxiety and depression, and flying down to Christchurch just to be around my old workmates. I took 4 months completely off paid work recover my health and make sure it never happens again.  

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for answers.  

I'm still going to a therapist once a week, but mostly recovered.  I'm not convinced remote work is actually a good idea, but the reward if I can make it work is to live in my current nice location, but have a wider variety of good meaningful employment options.

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence not arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
