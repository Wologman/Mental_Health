# Mental_Health

I had a really awful time transitioning to self-employed remote work. It was by far the worst year of my life, due mainly to some external factors. Working alone without a stable long term project definately compounded things. 

I found myself in an epic battle with anxiety and depression, and flying down to Christchurch just to be around my old workmates. I took four months off paid work recover my mental health and make sure it never happens again. I'm still going to a therapist once a week, but have mostly recovered.  

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for answers.  

I'm not convinced full time remote work is actually the best end goal for me. All else being equal I would rather have a normal workplace with colleagues right next to me. But the reward if I can succeed at remote work is huge.  I could live in a nice peaceful location, with lots of outdoors action and nice cycling but have a good variety of meaningful employment options.

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, effective remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence rather than arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
