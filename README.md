I had a really rough time transitioning to self-employed remote work, and also with my latest change of career direction.  There were some other external pressures on me at the time. I found myself in a 12 month battle with anxiety and depression, took 4 months off work, spent 3 of those going to a therapist each week.

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by trawling through the internet looking for answers.  Only the less personal ones are in this repo.
