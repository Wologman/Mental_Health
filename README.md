# Mental_Health

I had a really awful time transitioning to self-employed remote work, it was by far the worst year of my life.  Much of this was due to some external factors, but working alone without a stable long term project definately compounded things. 

I found myself in an epic battle with anxiety and depression, and flying down to the Christchurch office just to be around my old mates. I took four months off paid work recover my mental health and make sure it never happens again. I'm still going to a therapist once a week, but have mostly recovered.  

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for new answers.  This is a good for my own confidence to remind myself that I've already mastered the topic, there is nothing more to search for.

I'm not convinced full time remote work is actually the best end goal for me. All else being equal I'd rather have a normal workplace with fun colleagues next to me. But the reward if I can succeed at remote work is huge.  I could live in a nice peaceful location like Nelson, with lots of outdoors action and nice cycling but have a good variety of meaningful employment options.

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, effective remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence rather than arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
