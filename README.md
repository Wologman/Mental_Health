# Mental_Health

I had a really awful time while I was transitioning to self-employed remote work. It was by far the worst year of my life, due mainly to some external factors but working alone compounded everything. I found myself in an epic battle with anxiety and depression, and flying down to Christchurch just to be around my old workmates. I took 4 months completely off paid work recover my health and make sure it never happens again.  At the time of writing, I'm still going to a therapist once a week.

Eventually I found it better to write up my own notes than keep distracting myself by searching the internet looking for answers.  

Only the less personal files are in this repo. Topics covered: Anxiety, remote work habits, working alone, multipotentiality, building confidence not arrogance.  The format is for the Obsidian implementation of Markdown.  It's not perfect on GitHub.
