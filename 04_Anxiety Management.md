### 1. Ten Proven Methods for General Anxiety
*Methods in this section were mostly from Margaret Wehenberg’s book “The 10 Best-Ever
Anxiety Management Techniques”, second edition, 2018. The 1-4 are easy ones in the
category of making your whole body relaxed and healthy, because it’s part of the nervous
system and will help the brain to stay calm too. They should have nearly immediate effect.*

#### 1.1 Control Intake
**Method:** Reduce Sugar, alcohol, coffee.

**Reason:** Helps to keep blood sugar stable, alcohol is a depressant, and effects sleep, coffee affects sleep and also directly fires up parts of the brain that contribute to anxiety.

**Method:** Reduce stimulation from phone (notifications) and office environment.

**Reason:** Because the distractions themselves cause anxiety. Also with phone notifications
each little ding releases a little dose of dopamine in your brain, so you wind up needing to
be at that new base level, and anxious without it.

#### 1.2 Calming Breathing
Deep slow breaths, using the diaphragm. Stomach out-breath in, ideally a time ratio of 1:2
in/out. Do this to calm down when panicking or about to something that will be stressful.
Also on a daily basis to help stay calm.

#### 1.3 Practice Mindfulness
**Methods:**

• Try to practice observation of real time events without judging, just observe.
- When out running, paddling or biking, instead of day-dreaming like I normally would, try to pay attention to sensations, sound of cicadas, noise of the trees, rivers, waves, temperature, frost or snow crunching under foot, tyres on the road, other runners, cyclists, drivers.
- Meditation & Yoga don’t seem to be my thing, but stretching, Tàijíquán & Kung Fu are things I could do while practising mindfulness. Or sit by a river or some rocks andlisten to the noise of the water. Lying in a tent listening to the birds or rain or wind.

**Reason:** Mindfulness is about living in the moment, as opposed events in the future or past. So it is the anti-thesis to anxiety, which is about worrying about events that haven’t
happened yet or ruminating over past ones.

#### 1.4 Rest and Relaxation
**Method:** Aerobic exercise. I need this at least at the start of the day. The more the better.

**Reason:** Uses up adrenaline & toxic cortisol from anxiety, improves blood flow to the brain
and helps overall health.

**Method:** Stretching/Yoga/Tàijíquán

**Reason:** Promotes muscle relaxation, which restores calm. As noted earlier, it’s also a good time to practice mindfulness.

**Method:** Get plenty of sleep, & keep it regular. No computer late at night, and never go
straight from computer to bed, at least read for a little while first. Also change the timing of my diet, a bit more protein earlier in the day, something with carbohydrates in the evening.

**Reason:** Good sleep helps the brain to repair, build new neurons, replenish
neurotransmitters to maintain healthy balances. With the nutrition, it takes 12 hours for the
body to process proteins, but it needs a reasonable blood sugar level to use them for brain repair. Note this is the opposite advice than some health fads, but I’m not interested in loosing weight.

**Method:** Chose who I spend my time with carefully: Identify & minimise time with narcissistic, passive-agressive & chronically negative people. Maximise time with positive,
honest & fun people, regardless of their interests.

**Reason:** By hanging with positive people outside of my usual interests I’m allowing diversity, new ideas and positivity into my life, whilst contributing those things to others. I’m also improving my own resiliance to future setbacks and negative people, and countering any feelings of isolation.

*Methods 5,6 & 7 are similar in that they involve using the decision making part of the brain, the pre-frontal-cortex (PFC) to recognise patterns and tell your mind to change thoughts. They only work if you believe they will work and persist over months. In this way the neural pathways for those anxious thoughts diminish whilst others become stronger. Eventually the mind needs to spend less time and effort fighting off those anxious & negative thoughts.

#### 1.5 Stop Catastrophising Thoughts
**Method:** Learn to recognize catastrophising so I can use my PFC to tell myself to stop.
Catastrophising is when your mind actively seeks out the worst case scenario and ruminates over it. Learn to recognise this, and that it is just a feeling, not a response to an actual problem, then tell myself to stop thinking about it.

#### 1.6 Stop Anxious Thoughts
Similar to #5, but not necessarily catastrophising, just the same anxious thoughts happening over and over again. In this case, I can prepare by recognising what these thoughts are, and having replacement thoughts ready for when they occur. Write down a table, and add to it as new thoughts become troublesome.

#### 1.7 Contain Anxious Thoughts
When #6 is out of reach, for example the risk might be real. (The project might run overtime, the software might be buggy, there might be unforeseen delays, the idea might not work...) In this case, there is no point pretending the risk isn’t there. Better to make effort can be made to contain the thoughts so as to minimise their impact.

**Method:** Worry well, but only once.

**Reason:** If I really have to worry about something, do it properly, explore what could really
go wrong and the consequences. Reassure myself about how I’d deal with them. Then next time the thought comes remind myself I’ve already done it, nothing new here, move along.

**Method:** Planning

**Reason:** Anxiety is the fear of the unknown. Good planing is helpful because it takes away
the feeling of unknown and hopefully replaces it with a series of achievable steps and a
believable time-frame.

**Method:** Time constrain the worry. Allow myself to worry, but at a specific short time period (like 10 minutes) each day.

**Reason:** So I can free my mind from the worry the rest of the day. Also as with all the
methods in #5, 6 & 7, the neural pathways for these worries will diminish over time.

#### 1.8 Control Too Much Activity (TMA)
This is about managing quantity stress, by achieving balance rather than filling in time with an impossible list of goals that never get completed, compete with each other, so I feel always rushed and deprived of proper time out.

**Method:** Identify and stop perfectionism
• Plan for non-perfection, imagine a realistic outcome for tasks
• Recognise the negative consequences of perfectionism
• Distinguish the difference between import and urgent or inconsequential

**Reason:** Anxious behaviour is avoidant behaviour. Perfectionism always comes at the
expense of more important tasks that are likely a source of anxiety.

**Method:** Balance my time considering my values. Record time spent on different tasks, then examine if I’m spending this time proportionate to my values. Examine my values to make sure what I think of as my values is really accurate.

**Reason:** If this is out of align then the important tasks become a source of anxiety.

**Method:** Take time off work some things purely for fun. This can still mean being busy, but
the key difference is the outcome is unimportant. These must be things I like doing for the
journey not the destination. Like a lap on my gravel bike or MTB. Anything with laughter.

**Reason:** The flip side of TMA is being unable to switch off and relax. By consciously picking fun things with no end goal I am challenging this.

**Method:** Have a plan for unexpected down-time. Have a list of things to do for fun, low
priority task list, anything positive or productive.

**Reason:** As with the previous method, it is important to avoid the low that comes with
suddenly having some unexpected spare time by agonise over what to do with it.

#### 1.9 Talk Myself into Changing Behaviour
This is for when anxiety is holding me back from doing something. I need to challenge the
anxious thoughts and get on with the thing in question. This can be done with some
planning and the ABCD method. Write down the plan in a table.

**A- Action:** Identify the action being considered
Example: Start a Kaggle competition

**B-The Belief:** Identify the belief that is causing the anxiety
Example: I might find others’ impressive notebooks intimidating and feel discouraged

**C-The Consequences:** Identify and challenge the consequences of that belief
Example: It might hold me back from pushing further into data science

**D- Demands:** Challenge the demands you put on those assumptions.
Example: I’ve done these before and learned a lot from them, even when I didn’t make
much progress with the scores. I’m doing this with a bunch of really smart and competative people, it’s OK to find it hard. I have all the skills and talent needed to do well at this.

#### 1.10 Implement a Plan & Practice the three C’s 
**Calm, competence, confidence**

*This one seems mainly aimed at social anxiety, but seems applicable to some other
scenarios. Builds on the methods developed in previous sections.*

**Calm:** What ever works, including ideas from previous sections like slow breathing or
mindfulness, calming music, herbal tea, exercise.

**Competence:** This is about preparation, mental preparation, planning, training in any skills 
needed for the tasks I’m worried about.

**Confidence:** Practice the behaviour. If necessary practice in an environment where the consequences are lower.

#### 1.11 Coping with toxic people
Confidence is precious, never let anyone tear mine down to boost their own ego. Either In work or personal life. Before it gets to that try to discuss the matter, don’t just let it slip. Refer to texts like [Non-violent communication](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71730.Nonviolent_Communication) by M. Rosenberg. Enlist the support of professionals if appropriate. What ever I do, remember the problem isn't about me. 

I don’t need to be someone’s emotional punching bag. Past misfortune is no justification for ongoing abuse. If a partner ever tries to do this to me and won't change, walk away and never look back, she can sort herself out.

### 2. Control Work Specific Anxiety
- Recognize that some level of anxiety is normal, and will always be there. It means you care. Anxiety by its self is not unhealthy, unless you believe it is [1]. Learn to manage and accept some stress, use it to push yourself on.

- Chose work that has meaning to me, as opposed to trying to impress others. It’s also better for self-esteem and confidence.

  **Reason:** By needing to impress others your life is a constant competition to earn admiration and respect, one that you can never finish or win. You’re only as good as your last success. By contrast the mere effort of chasing meaning should be a source of pride for me, including my failures.
  
- Understand the difference between sharing things I’ve done because I’m passionate about them, and boasting about my achievements to feel valued. The first is healthy, you’re encouraging others, sharing knowledge and being transparent. The second isn’t, (basically the same argument as in the previous point).

- Stop comparing myself to others. Let them run their race, I’ll enjoy mine at my own pace, mistakes and all.

- Get some aerobic exercise done before work. Or at least bike to work. If that’s not possible or safe, move to a better city or find another job. Really, nothing is so important it’s worth risking your life every day just to get to work healthy. Cities that can’t get their shit together in this century should have less people.

- Have clear goals and a plan to reach them. Even if it needs constant refinement.

  **Reason:** So I feel in control of my future, and can remind myself of the series of achievable smaller steps to get there.

- Two TODO lists, one high priority, focus on one task at a time. One low priority, do those things when there is time to fill in to avoid panic about unexpected spare time. Otherwise don’t worry about them, they’re not important (yet).

- Start on tasks that cause the most worry first (not necessarily the hardest) so they are over and I can stop worrying about them. Or use a prioritization matrix (not quite the same idea, but also good as it discourages avoidant behaviour).

- If I’m really get stuck on a hard task, it may be better to move to an easy one to get something completed. Almost counter to the previous points, except that I’ve already tried the hard one, rather than avoid it, now time to feel like making progress. Then have another go at the hard one!

- Avoid social media, and newspapers during work time.  Better still avoid them completely for periods to get a break. Try [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) or Duo Lingo or similar if needing some distracting boost, just find something more positive.

- Take a break after an hour, and get away from the screen during them. Use the super-productivity pomodoro timer if this helps.

- Don’t over-work, it’s not productive, and it will come at the expense of social or exercise time, which are also important, 32 is the new 40. Four hours of focused work like programming or maths + 1-2 for admin each day is already winning.
