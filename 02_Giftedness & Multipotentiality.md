The multipotentiality idea seems to be resonating quite well with me.   The key seems to be acknowledge it's OK to be good at lots of things, but not the best at any of them.  And it's quite OK to have a windy and adaptive career. Inovation often comes at the boundaries between fields, or from being able to see the larger picture.  This is a positive feeling for me, I like variety and I'm a natural life-long learner.  I just need to find a model that works for me.

Also by adopting some of these more flexible models I can meet all my goals without needing to do full time  remote.

#### Structure of proposed work-life models
The proposed models from [*How to be everything*](http://howtobeeverything.com/) are:

- **The group hug** -- One really challenging job with loads of appreciation for varied skills, and room for growth.	I've always aimed for this, but for 12 years it felt out of reach for my for my combination of prefered locations, skills & interests.  This is how I've lost my way a bit, 'tech' jobs in New Zealand usually just mean software development.
- **The Slash Career** -- Combine a bunch of different jobs at the same time, with different needs met by each into a satisfying lifestyle.  This  could work for me, if I'm really deliberate about choosing the right mix, and maximum 3, typically 2 things at any one time.  Otherwise I tend to feel overwhelmed.
- **The Einstein** -- A 'good enough' on-site job that is stimulating, meaningful & financially secure, but NOT pushing me to the limit. So I have time energy to persue other things the rest of my day or week. 
- **The Phoenix** -- Dive really deep into each single career, but every few years change to something else.  Effectively what I've been doing by accident.  Could work, but the secret is ideally to start easing into the new thing, before finishing the last one.  Avoid dramatic down-time that can be soul-destroying.


#### So the winner for me is: The Einstein
This seems like the best end-goal for me.  But I should stay open and mindful of the other models as opportunities come and go.  For example, today's *cutting edge* thing, can be tomorrow's *good enough* thing.  Then I can start something new for the cutting edge.  So it's a mix of Einstein and Phoenix.

**20 hours *good enough* on-site job** - Engineering, programming, GIS programming, machine-vision.  Needs to meet the need for human company, I just don't thrive doing full time remote.  Even if this means moving location, it's worth it.
- **Enough remuneration** to make ends meet on its own, so I don't need to worry about finance.  Achievable with my modest lifestyle.
- **Not draining** - Ideally 20 hours/week on-site in a friendly, fun workplace.
- **Something meaningful** - Connected to something I feel good about.  Social justice, conservation, biodiversity, clean water, sanitation, clean energy, non-motorised transport, low impact urban planning, sustainable food production.  All good things.

**10 hours cutting edge** - Can be remote, paid or volunteer.  What ever I fancy since the world is my oyster for this.  Training, Kaggle comps, Compost club, ML for conservation & biodiversity, ML for CFD, tracking pirate fishing fleets with remote satellite imagery, building some of my long delayed home projects, heat engines, record setting bikes.

**5 hours admin, networking & volunteering**  Things that are needed to keep the dream alive, make friends and remain involved in my local community.

The thing I'm always going to struggle with to some extent is that I like doing practical/experimental/fieldwork type things, as opposed to purely computer work.  I should take every chance I get to blend this into the above three to get some hands-on time.

[*Journey into your rainforest mind* ](https://rainforestmind.wordpress.com/2017/12/28/psychotherapy-and-giftedness/) By Paula Prober. 

Notes from: *Multipotentiality, Giftedness and Career Choice: A review*, Rysiew, Shore and Leeb, Journal of counseling and development, October 1999:

- The definition isn't consistently agreed on, but is generally something like having high achievement across a wide range of interests.  Most people with high IQ have a reasonable level of multipotentiality, but it's not the same thing.
- Most widely used definition *The ability to select and develop any number of competencies to a high level*
- Career indecision results from an abundance of four things: abilities, motivation, interests and opportunity.  So in my case, this isn't the whole story.  I've had the opportunities I was accustomed to suddenly restricted when I returned to NZ.  I stubbornly stuck to a plan that I had lots of motivation for, but was no longer plausible.  This was a recipe for trouble, and why I struggled for so long.  But not quite the typical source of indecision referred to.
- Because career selection is typically a narrowing down process, multipotentialed people struggle, because few jobs actually provide an outlet for people with a multitude of talents.  -- I've always felt frustrated with this.  I should to be more accepting that I just need to keep some things for outside my career path, and focus on a narrower set for that.

[From Puttylike Quiz](https://puttylike.com/quiz/)   Emilie Wapnick's website. Apparently I'm a mixed style multipotentialite. Mixed-style multipotentialites are characterised by the following:

- Are happiest when they have a few different projects on their plate at any given time.
- Love variety, but get overwhelmed when they have too much.
- Sometimes go through periods where they are juggling a bunch of different projects and periods where they are deeply invested in a single thing.

This resonates really well with me.  As a multipotentialite, I have cool superpowers, specific needs, and unique challenges. And there are so many other people like me! Actually it's 5% of humanity, including some obvious others in my life.

[This blog has some useful ideas for the topic of career choice](https://giftedchallenges.blogspot.com/2017/04/choices-exclude-existential-burden-of.html) Summarising:

- **What do I value the most in life**: Investigative discovery, creativity, practical hands-on things, social justice, biodiversity preservation and restoration, climate change action, non-motorised mobility, sustainable food production, clean energy, liveable cities, working with people that have similar values.
- **Which of these interests translate into engaging and meaningful work**: This depends a bit on the location.  In NZ: biodiversity, food production.  Overseas: clean energy
- **How might I spend my day**:  How exactly do I blend this career into a lifestyle and place I like to be?
		- Either by having an amazingly lucky job, or by mixing and matching
		- Potentially this was the benefit of being a self-employed consultant instead of a regular 40-hour arrangement with a single employer.  
		- But if I could do 30 instead of 40, this is also an acceptable path.  I can keep up my other interests in the extra time.
		- Part of this day should involve making things, or solving practical problems, outside of a computer.  This is the thing that most eludes me, and I should look for solutions that keep this dream alive.
- **What abilities and skills do I long to express**:  Creativity, mentoring & encouraging others, mathematics, physics, investigative discovery, sharing knowledge.
- **Do I have an overriding passion I must pursue**: No, not at all, I just want to do something meaningful that challenges me and I can do well.
- **Can I envision some compromise or means of accommodating my varied interests:** This seems to be the key.  I just can't do all the things I'm passionate about or good at.  That was obvious the day I chose physics over a pro sailing career. But I can make compromises to have a full life, inside and outside work, and accept that I can't do everything.
