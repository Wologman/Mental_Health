This idea seems to be resonating quite well with me.  I should explore it a bit further.  The key idea seems to be multipotentiality.  Just be careful I'm not going down some unnecessary rabit hole.

Notes from: *Multipotentiality, Giftedness and Career Choice: A review*, Rysiew, Shore and Leeb, Journal of counseling and development, October 1999.

- The definition isn't consistantly agreed on, but is generally something like having high achievement across a wide range of interests.  Most people with high IQ have a reasonable level of multipotentiality, but it's not the same thing.
- Most widely used definition *The ability to select and develop any number of competencies to a high level*
- Career indecision relults from an abundance of four things: abilities, motivation, interests and opportunity.  So in my case, I've actually not had quite this.  I've had the opportunities I was accustomed to suddenly restricted when I returned to NZ.  I was trapped in a negative space because I was stubbournly sticking to my planned interests that I had so much motivation for.  This was a recipe for trouble, and why I struggled for so long.  But not quite the typical source of indecision referred to.
- Because career selection is typically a narrowing down process, multipotentialed people struggle, because few jobs actually provide an outlet for people with a multitude of talents.  -- Yes this is very applicable to me, I've always felt frustrated with this.   I need to be more accepting that I just need to keep some things for outside my career path, and focus on a narrower set for that.

[From Puttylike Quiz](https://puttylike.com/quiz/)    Emilie Wapnick's website. Apparently I'm a mixed style multipotentialite. Mixed-style multipotentialites are characterised by the following:

-   Are happiest when they have a few different projects on their plate at any given time.
-   Love variety, but get overwhelmed when they have too much.
-   Sometimes go through periods where they are juggling a bunch of different projects and periods where they are deeply invested in a single thing.

This resonates really well with me.

As a multipotentialite, I have cool superpowers, specific needs, and unique challenges. And there are so many other people like me! Actually it's 5% of humanity.

[This blog has some useful ideas for the topic of career choice](https://giftedchallenges.blogspot.com/2017/04/choices-exclude-existential-burden-of.html) Summarising:

- **What do I value the most in life**: Investigative discovery, creativity, social justice, biodiversity preservation and restoration, climate change action, non-motorised mobility, sustainable food production, clean energy, liveable cities.
- **Which of these interests translate into engaging and meaningful work**: This depends a bit on the location.  In NZ: biodiversity, food production.  Overseas: clean energy
- **How might I spend my day**:  How exactly do I blend this career into a lifestyle and place I like to be. -- Either by having an amazingly lucky job, or by mixing and matching, potentially this was the benefit of being a self-employed consultant instead of a regular 40 hour arrangement with a single employer.  But if I could do 30 instead of 40, this is also an acceptable path.  I can keep up my other interests in the extra time.
- **What abilities and skills do I long to express**:  Creativity, mentoring & encouraging others, mathematics, physics, investigative discovery, sharing knowledge.
- **Do I have an overriding passion I must persue**: No, not at all, I just want to do something meaningful that challenges me and I can do well.
- **Can I envision some compromise or means of accommodating their varied interests:** This seems to be the key.  I just can't do all the things I'm passionate about or good at.  That was obvoius the day I chose physics over a pro sailing career. But I can make compromises to have a full life, inside and outside work, and accept that I can't do everything.
